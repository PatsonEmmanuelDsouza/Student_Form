# Lead Collector

This is a Python application built using Tkinter to collect leads offline. It allows users to input lead information, including email, name, phone number, interested program, and current level of education.

## Objectives
- Create an Offline Lead Collection Form: The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly form that allows users to input data. This form should function seamlessly even without an internet connection, ensuring data can be collected in any environment.

- Data Storage: Implement a mechanism to store the collected lead data locally on the user's computer. The data should be stored in a structured format, making it easy to access and manage.

- Export to CSV: Provide functionality to export the collected lead data to a CSV file. This feature enables users to easily share and analyze the collected information, for example, using tools like Microsoft Excel.

## Features

- Collect lead information.
- Save collected leads locally.
- Export leads to a CSV file.
